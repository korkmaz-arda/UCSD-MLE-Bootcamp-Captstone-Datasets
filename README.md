## Food 101 Dataset
The Food 101 dataset consists of 101,000 images across 101 different food categories. Each category includes 1,000 images, showcasing a wide variety of dishes from diverse cuisines. The dataset is split into a training set with 75,750 images (750 per category) and a test set with 25,250 images (250 per category). This dataset is a significant benchmark for food recognition and image classification tasks.

## TrayTrack Dataset
The TrayTrack Dataset consists of 1,854 images specifically designed for tracking food trays. The dataset includes images with annotations for tray locations in COCO 1.0 format. Augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations (such as rotation, flipping, and cropping) and color transformations (such as color jittering, grayscaling, and brightness/contrast adjustments), were applied to increase the dataset's size and variability. These augmentations help to create a more comprehensive dataset that simulates a wide range of conditions. The aim of this dataset is to support experimentation in automated tray tracking, with potential applications in improving operational efficiency in food service environments and dietary management systems.
